# Kaggle_DetectingLemonCars
Here lies the code used in the Kaggle competition for detecting lemon cars (cars that were bad buys because they were likely dysfunctional). 
The code takes a dirty dataset containing a plethora of factors related to car purchases, cleans it, isolates import features, and then uses the
processed data in several ML models to determine the best way of predicting lemon cars. Final model (the xgboost one) had a test accuracy of 76%.
